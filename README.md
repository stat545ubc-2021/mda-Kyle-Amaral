# Mini-Data Analysis Milestone 1 Description

#### What is the project?
##### Milestone 1
This is a Mini-Data Analysis for STAT 545A, specifically the first Milestone of 3, called Milestone 1. The purpose of this project is:
- To continue to get familiar with how to use R and Rstudio 
- To apply functions and tools taught in class to perform our own data manipulation and visualization on preset datasets
- To practice thinking of research questions that can be answered with the provided data
- To produce an R markdown file that can be reproduced and that is clear

#### What files are in the Project Folder/Repository
Within "mda-Kyle-Amaral" you will find 6 files: README.md, .gitignore, mda-Kyle-Amaral.Rproj, mda-Milestone-1.Rmd, mda-Milestone-1.md, and mda-Milestone-1_files/figure-gfm

##### Repository 
- README.md contains a thorough description on the content that can be found in this repository. The README.md file can also be used to produce a PDF or html

- .gitignore specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore

- mda-Kyle-Amaral.Rproj contains project options and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the file system 

- mda-Milestone-1.Rmd is an R markdown file that was created to contain answers to Mini-Data Analysis Milestone 1. This file also includes code chunks that were used to perform some data manipulation and data visualization

- mda-Milestone-1.md is the file that was rendered from knitting mda-Milestone-1.Rmd to a github-document file.

- mda-Milestone-1_files/figure-gfm is a folder that contains three files that are necessary to be able to see the three graphs produced from the mda-Milestone-1.Rmd in the mda-Milestone-1.md file

#### How to run the code in the folder
Open Rstudio and start a new project. Link this new project to the mda-Kyle-Amaral repository on github by copying the url that can be found in the repository on github to the Rstudio window that opens. Pull the files and run code by highlighting the desired code and clicking run.
